However, I don&#39;t expect my customers to take the hit if an order is lost while shipped or broken along the way.  I also don&#39;t want to pay outrageous prices for shipping, and you shouldn&#39;t either.  My orders are shipped as cost efficiently as possible so that everybody wins.  About 95% of the time glass and fragile items arrive intact as they are packaged very carefully before they are shipped.  However, every great once in a while, something will be broken in shipping.  This is out of my hands as I cannot be responsible for how packages are handled once they leave my hands.  To avoid a secondary purchase of items that may be broken in shipping, I add insurance to any package containing glass prior to shipping.  When an item is broken or lost during shipment, the USPS will require an insurance claim to be filed before any replacements can be shipped out.  If any items are broken or lost during shipment, please let me know as soon as possible.  At that point, the customer will be required to send a photo of the damaged products.  My shop will file the claim through the USPS.  About 10 business days after filing the claim, the customer will receive a letter from the USPS requesting that the damaged products, original packaging, all packaging materials, and said letter be presented to their local post office.  This is VERY IMPORTANT, as failure to do so will result in a secondary purchase of the damaged products.  Once the damaged items are presented the claim should be approved and the replacements will be shipped out directly to the customer.","policy_refunds":"Personalized items will not be eligible for return, refund, or exchange as they cannot be resold.  Any damages due to shipping must be reported as soon as items are delivered via email or conversation.  Please be extra careful when leaving notes on personalized items as the personalization on your products will appear EXACTLY as it is noted when ordered.  If a mistake is made in the notes on behalf of the customer, the customer will be responsible for any shipping and\/or labor charges to correct the error.","policy_additional":null,"policy_seller_info":"Anyone with questions should contact shop owner LeeAnn Logan through conversation or directly through email at leeannmtjarks@yahoo.com.

Vintage rhinestones including foil backed rhinestones are very delicate and must be cleaned with extreme care, preferably a dry method so as to not damage the foil backings.

You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love\/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (6-8 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)\r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and\/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.

This bottle has retained its integrity but collected character.  :)\r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by - please convo me with any questions you may have!","creation_tsz":1412699142,"ending_tsz":1423329942,"original_creation_tsz":1412699142,"last_modified_tsz":1412699142,"price":"12.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["old bottle","old whiskey bottle","whiskey","flask","glass flask","whiskey flask","old flask","vintage bottle","antique bottle","antique flask","antique glass","vintage flask"],"category_path":["Vintage","Antique","100 Years or Older"],"category_path_ids":[69150437,69151627,68901198],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":15600322,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1412699142,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/206264489\/antique-glass-whiskey-flask-guaranteed?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":0,"num_favorers":0,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":null,"processing_max":null,"who_made":"someone_else","is_supply":"false","when_made":"1900s","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":663977515,"hex_code":"A9794D","red":169,"green":121,"blue":77,"hue":29,"saturation":54,"brightness":66,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1412699142,"listing_id":206264489,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/2\/9591371\/il_75x75.663977515_dgv8.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/2\/9591371\/il_170x135.663977515_dgv8.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/2\/9591371\/il_570xN.663977515_dgv8.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/050\/2\/9591371\/il_fullxfull.663977515_dgv8.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":663977047,"hex_code":"B7A698","red":183,"green":166,"blue":152,"hue":27,"saturation":16,"brightness":71,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1412699142,"listing_id":206264489,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_75x75.663977047_9otx.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_170x135.663977047_9otx.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_570xN.663977047_9otx.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_fullxfull.663977047_9otx.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":1000},{"listing_image_id":663849814,"hex_code":"887164","red":136,"green":113,"blue":100,"hue":22,"saturation":26,"brightness":53,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1412699142,"listing_id":206264489,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_75x75.663849814_hokf.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_170x135.663849814_hokf.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_570xN.663849814_hokf.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_fullxfull.663849814_hokf.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":663977367,"hex_code":"9F7D63","red":159,"green":125,"blue":99,"hue":26,"saturation":37,"brightness":62,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1412699142,"listing_id":206264489,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_75x75.663977367_1pgc.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_170x135.663977367_1pgc.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_570xN.663977367_1pgc.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9591371\/il_fullxfull.663977367_1pgc.jpg","full_height":1000,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":663978485,"hex_code":"8A8A84","red":138,"green":138,"blue":132,"hue":60,"saturation":4,"brightness":54,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1412699142,"listing_id":206264489,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9591371\/il_75x75.663978485_5991.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9591371\/il_170x135.663978485_5991.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9591371\/il_570xN.663978485_5991.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9591371\/il_fullxfull.663978485_5991.jpg","full_height":824,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":9591371,"shop_name":"PurpleFinchVintage","user_id":49154230,"creation_tsz":1402098248,"title":"~Vintage home goods, accessories and collectibles~","announcement":"Welcome to Purple Finch Vintage!
